Linux Kernel Assignment : 

1.Problem #1     Block System call : 


>block system call for date command 
>that means you don't have to uninstall date command but if you run kernel must not accept 
>do the same Firefox as well

2. Problem #2 :  play with directory 

  >create a directory without name from command line
  >create a directory with name "-okgoogle"


for the 1st Problem i.e block system call i used two commands mainly 
 
		1. which
		2. chmod

	for date i first ran: {which date} to know the location of file
				than used sudo chmod -x /usr/bin/date (we need to use sudo command which means super user do as we need to change file permissions which require root permissions)
	
	then repeated the same procedure for firefox command now when we run any of the date or firefox we get result as permission denied.
	
	in the command chmod -x the {-x} part stands for removing executing permission from the file.


for the second problem 

the first part was to create a directory with empty string as name.
		
		for this i used mkdir ' ' command which executed without any errors.

the second part was to create a directory with '-okgoogle' name while doing this i encountered an error which made me look into it and i found out that '-' means something else in terminal so had to use escape charater to pass '-' as a common string so my final command was 
		mkdir ./-okgoogle this ran without any errors.
